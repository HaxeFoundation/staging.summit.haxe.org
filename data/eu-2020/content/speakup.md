Are you:

* doing something exciting with Haxe that you would love to tell us about
* solving a pesky problem (workflows and tooling, anyone?);
* looking to pass on some Haxian wisdom?

Then we would love to hear from you!

We are interested in quick showcases, more thorough presentations and full workshops.

Not sure if you should get up on that stage? Apply anyway! We will help you figure it out.
